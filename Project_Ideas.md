These are possible project ideas to take what has already been done and expand it.

TODO add expected difficulty ratings
TODO add useful resources
 
 - Support arbitrary NxM probability matrices
 - Accept command line arguments for:
   - Probability matrix
   - Number of iterations
   - RNG seed
 - Make execution deterministic via:
   - Use PRNG
   - Use fixed or passed in seed
   - Ensure rng calls are made in the same order each time 
 - Map grayscale values into colors
